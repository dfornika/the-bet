# The Bet

Every year I make a bet with a friend over the Stanley Cup playoffs.
We started in 1997 and set the stakes at $2. The prize doubled each year until
it reached $100.

## Rules

At the start of each playoff season, we take turns picking teams.
The loser of the previous year chooses first.
Whoever has the Stanley Cup Champion team wins $100.
